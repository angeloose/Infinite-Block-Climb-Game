# Infinite-Block-Climb-Game
Never-ending platformer game, get as high as you can!

Simple game made using PyGame, one of my first that I have made that works properly that I used with help! Keep climbing as high as you can and get a point for every platform you land on successfully.

Controls:
WASD : Move around

Spacebar : Jump (depending on how long you hold down the key your jump height will differ)
